## Description


When I joined the current book club I am in. They were looking to use an Excel sheet to share the books they wanted to read with the 40 members (give or take) of the club. I felt that it was not the best option so I advised that maybe we could use a website and that maybe I could create said website. The leader of our book club agreed and so I created this project. Below you will find some quick facts about this project!

• Built custom website for book club using C#/ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and MySQL so they can share and like books they want to read

• Created master administrator that can share admin access with other users with the help of Entity Framework

• User accounts remain lock until an admin approves the user to join the website

• MySQL stores logs of actions performed by other users such as when new accounts are created, new books are recommended or deleted, an admin accepts a new user into the website, or if admin freezes/deletes another user's account so admins can have written records of major actions

#### Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap4
- C#
- ASP.NET
- Entity Frameworks
- MySql & MySql Workbench
- Visual Studio Code
